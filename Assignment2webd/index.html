            <h2>Welcome to My Professional Portfolio</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Web Developer and Data Scientist with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master of Science in Information Systems candidate at Northeastern University.
                I have a strong passion and enthusiasm for learning new technologies and domains, especially Data Science and Robotics. I have completed multiple online courses and certifications in Python, Data Science, and Robotics, demonstrating my ability to acquire new skills and apply them to real-world problems and challenges.

                I have also developed web applications using Angular, PL/SQL, C#, and ASP.NET for the health care domain of Cognizant, one of the leading IT service providers in the world. I collaborated with a team of developers and testers to deliver high-quality solutions that met the client's requirements and expectations. I used HTML5, TypeScript, and Robotics to enhance the user interface and functionality of the web applications, increasing the user retention rate by 25%. My goal is to secure a summer internship in 2024 in the USA, where I can contribute to the growth and innovation of the industry with my skills and expertise.
